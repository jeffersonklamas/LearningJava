## My first interface.

Hello, welcome!

This repository contains a simple interface development in Java, just as a learning tool for use in the main project.

I used the **NeetBeans IDE**, **Java 8** and **JFrame Form** to create this screen.

Until then I didn't have the knowledge that this was the way to create an interface in Java, although I have already studied a little of the language this was the first time that I used this tool.

Good studies.
